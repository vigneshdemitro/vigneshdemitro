# 👋 Hi, I’m Vigneshwar Pasupathi

Senior **Full Stack Engineer** with **5+ years of hands-on experience in software development** and **10+ years of overall professional experience**. I currently work as a **Guidewire Analytics Developer at Guidewire Software**, building **scalable, data-driven enterprise web applications**.

My background includes a unique transition from **Civil Engineering (4+ years)** into software development, which gives me a strong foundation in **structured problem-solving, system thinking, and design discipline**—skills I apply daily while building reliable and maintainable software systems.

## 🔄 Career Transition: Civil Engineering → Software Engineering

I began my professional journey in the **Civil Engineering and Architectural Design** domain, where I spent **4+ years** working on real-world projects involving **design planning, technical drawings, site coordination, and stakeholder management**. This phase of my career shaped my approach to problem-solving with a strong emphasis on **structure, precision, and long-term thinking**.

Driven by a deep interest in technology and product development, I transitioned into **software engineering** through focused upskilling and hands-on learning. Since then, I’ve spent **5+ years building and scaling product-based web applications**, applying the same engineering rigor to software systems—designing solutions that are **scalable, maintainable, and reliable**.

This cross-domain journey enables me to bridge **design thinking with software architecture**, bringing a unique perspective to building high-quality, user-centric products.
